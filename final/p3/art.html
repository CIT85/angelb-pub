        <p>Aztec art, infleunced by other indigenous groups such as the Olmec, Teotihuacan, and Maya, is seen as an important aspect to Aztec culture. Forms of art such as music, poetry, and sculptures were commonly used to honor and praise their gods.
        <br>The Aztecs created a rich variety of art pieces from massive stone sculpturesâ€”to small crafted pottery.</p>

    <h4>The Meaning</h4>
        <p>Undestanding Aztec art fundamentally dives down to religion and symbolism, as both seem to be interwoven. Studying Aztec art shows a mix of religion and stories, with important gods like Huitzilopochtli, the god of war and the sun, and Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent god. The bright colors, fancy designs, and unique shapes in Aztec art aren't just for looks, they actually mean something special connected to the gods. It's like their way of talking about spiritual things through their art.</p>

    <section id="poetry">
        <h2>Poetry</h2>
        <p>The Nahuatl language spoken by the Aztecs did not have a dedicated word for poetry, but rather used a metaphor "flowers and songs" to represent the meaning. 
        <br>Poetry was the key to the Aztec world and in their mythology. It was their philosophy, their theology. Poetry to the Aztecs, came from their god Ometeotl; the father and the mother, the embodiment of masculine and feminine. </p>

        Flowers are our only garments,
        only songs make our pain subside,
        diverse flowers on earth,
        Ohuaya ohuaya.
        <br> Perhaps my friends will be lost,
        my companions will vanish
        when I lie down in that place, I Yoyontzin -Ohuaye!-
        in the place of song and of Life Giver,
        Ohuaya ohuaya.
        <br>Does no one know where we are going?
         Do we go to God's home or
        do we live only here on earth?
        Ah ohuaya.
        <br>Let your hearts know,
        oh princes, oh eagles and jaguars
        that we will not be friends forever,
        only for a moment here, then we go
        to Life Giver's home,
        Ohuaya ohuaya. <br>

    <h4>Music Practices</h4>
        <p> The Mexica people had different types of music, and a big part of it was sacred hymns. These songs praised great rulers and gods like Ometeotl, Tlaloc, Huitzilopochtli, and Tezcatlipoca. The hymns told stories about what the gods did and were used to ask for things like rain or success in battle. They were performed on special occasions and came with complex dances. Besides the serious cantares, Aztec music also included more fun songs like love songs and those about everyday life. While cantares were for religious stuff, the Mexica had a bunch of other songs that added excitement and variety to their music scene.</p>

        <br>
    <h4>Music And Aztec Warriors</h4>
        <p> The music for Aztec warriors, especially during times of battle, was associated with the cantares, also known as "ghost songs." These mystical songs recounted historical deeds and were performed to motivate and prepare warriors for battle. Specially trained singers, dancers, and actors took part in these ritual ceremonies. The music and dance were believed to help warriors enter a trance-like state, establishing a connection with ancestors and gods. The reenactment of past battles and human sacrifices in these performances aimed to inspire and energize the warriors, enhancing their psychological readiness for warfare. The music served both a practical and spiritual purpose in preparing and bolstering the Aztec warriors for the challenges they faced on the battlefield.</p>
