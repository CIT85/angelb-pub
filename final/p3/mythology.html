        <h2>Toltec Culture And The Inspiration Of Aztec Civilization</h2>

        </figure>
        <p>The Aztecs adopted many mythological traditions that originally belonged to the Toltec culture, incorporating them into their own beliefs and shaping their cultural identity. Primarily, 
            the Toltecs inspired Aztec methods of worship.</p>
        <p>Earlier Toltec culture significantly influenced the Aztecs through the adoption of myths. The Aztecs looked up to the Toltecs. The Toltecs were seen as wise and noble, impacting Aztec worship practices, including human sacrifices and devotion to the god Quetzalcoatl. The term "toltecayotl" became linked with culture, signaling innovation and excellence.
            These worshipping influences involved human sacrifices and the contribution to Aztec-adopted myths and legends, one example being the infamous cult of the god Quetzalcoatl. 
            In Aztec creation stories, the vast Aztec empire and cultural exchanges led to various tales. For instance, the story of Tlaltecuhtli, whose body became the earth, reflects earlier civilizations' ideas. The creation narrative involves Ometeotl, a dual-god, and their four divine children shaping earth and humanity. Tlaltecuhtli's demise, a waterborne creature, resulted in the formation of the sky and earth.
        The Legend of the 5 Suns is a key Aztec creation tale, describing the world's formation and destruction four times before the current era ruled by Huitzilopochtli. Each sun was linked to a god, and neglecting the gods could allow the Tzitzimimeh to conquer the sun, bringing an endless, earthquake-filled night. </p>

        <h3>Aztec Creation Myths</h3>
        <p>Due to the Aztecs' vast empire and their interactions with other cultures, they don't have just one creation myth; there are several to explore. The Aztecs blended their own earlier traditions with existing creation myths from various cultures, creating a mix of old and new ideas. A great example of this blending is seen in the story of Tlaltecuhtli, a monstrous being whose body turned into the earth—an idea borrowed from earlier civilizations.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>To understand this better, let's go back to the beginning of time, where an androgynous dual-god named Ometeotl emerged from nothingness. Ometeotl had four children: Xipe Totec, the god of seasons and rebirth; Tezcatlipoca, the god of the night sky and sorcery; Quetzalcoatl, the god of air and wind; and Huitzilopochtli, the war god and god of the sun. These four divine siblings played a crucial role in creating the earth and humanity, though they often argued about their roles, especially when it came to deciding who would become the sun...

            <h3>Creation Myths</h3>
        <p>The main creation myth in Aztec mythology is, <q>The Legend of the 5 Suns.</q> The Aztecs believed that the world was created and afterwards destroyed four times, with these different versions of the earth being identified by which god was that world's sun: </p>
        <p>In the beginning, there was emptiness (Aztec Creation Story 2013, 'In the Beginning', para 1). The dual god of the Aztecs, Ometecuhtli, brought itself into existence. The deity was considered both good and bad, embodying chaos and order, as well as both male and female. Ometecuhtli had the ability to bear children and had four offspring: Huizilopochtli, Quetzalcoatl, Tezcatlipoca, and Xipe Totec. Each of these gods represented a cardinal direction—south, east, west, and north. These four gods collaborated to create water, other deities, and the sea monster Cipactli. 
        Cipactli, a creature with features of a fish and a crocodile, served as the source of the cosmos. As the gods continued their creative endeavors, Cipactli devoured their creations. In response, the four gods joined forces to attack and pull Cipactli in four directions. This act resulted in the formation of the universe, with thirteen heavens extending from her head, the earth in the middle, and her tail reaching down to the underworld, Mictlan.
        The narrative of the Aztecs revolves around cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. According to their creation story, when the world faces destruction, it undergoes renewal through the sacrificial act of one of the gods, leading to the creation of a new sun (Aztec Creation Story 2013, 'Rebirth', para 1). This idea gives rise to the legend of the five suns, representing the five instances of the world's rebirth.

        <h3><b>The Five Suns:</b></h3>
        <ul>
        <li><u>The First Sun - Jaguar Sun (Nahui Ocelotl)</u><br>
            <br>
        <figure><img src="proj_images/first-sun.jpg" alt="first" width="250" height="250" loading="lazy">
            <figcaption id="gods"><cite>First sun god, Nahui Ocelotl</cite></figcaption></figure>
        <p id="cb">In order to bring the world to its full form, it was necessary to create a powerful source of energy, the sun. This idea is crucial to the cycles in Aztec cosmology, where the sun must be brought into existence through a sacrificial act—the sacrifice of the god Tezcatlipoca. Tezcatlipoca ended up being only half a sun, leaving the initial creation unfinished and his light dim. In this early era, the gods crafted giants from ashes. A conflict arose between Quetzacoatl and Tezcatlipoca (Aztec Creation Story 2013, 'The first sun - jaguar sun', para 3), leading to the sun being knocked from the sky. Tezcatlipoca then dispatched jaguars to eliminate the giants.</p></li>
        <li><u>The Second Sun - Wind Sun (Nahui Ehecatl)</u><br>
            <br>
            <figure><img src="proj_images/second-sun.jpg" alt="second" width="250" height="250" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption id="gods1"><cite>Second sun god, Nahui Ehecatl</cite></figcaption></figure>
        <p id="cb1">Quetzalcoatl replaced his brother as the sun, and during this time, humans were created. They lived off piñon nuts, and everything was peaceful. Through time, the people became corrupt, and Tezcatlipoca transformed them into monkeys. This led an angered Quetzalcoatl to unleash a hurricane to sweep away the monkeys.</p></li>
        <li><u>The Third Sun - Rain Sun (Nahui Quiahuitl)</u><br>
            <br>
            <figure><img src="proj_images/third-sun.jpg" alt="third" width="250" height="250" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption id="gods2"><cite>Third sun god, Nahui Quiahuitl</cite></figcaption></figure>
        <p id="cb2">Tlaloc, an early creation and the god of rain and water, took on the role of the next sun. However, Tezcatlipoca upset Tlaloc by stealing his wife, leaving Tlaloc heartbroken (Aztec Creation Story 2013, 'The Third Sun - Rain Sun', para 1). Although Tlaloc shone as the sun, he refused to bring rain in spite, ignoring the pleas of the people. As a result, drought plagued the earth, and in a final act, Tlaloc made it rain fire, leading to the destruction of the world.</p></li>
        <li><u>The Fourth Sun -  Water Sun (Nahui Atl)</u><br>
            <br>
            <figure><img src="proj_images/fourth-sun.jpg" alt="fourth" width="250" height="250" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption id="gods3"><cite>Fourth sun god, Nahui Atl</cite></figcaption></figure>
        <p id="cb3">The gods chose Tlaloc's sister, Chalchiuhtlicue, to become the next sun. Driven by jealousy, Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl attacked Chalchiuhtlicue. As she fell, the sky opened, causing water to flood the earth and bringing about another round of destruction. During the dark period between suns, Quetzalcoatl retrieved the bones of the deceased from the underworld and utilized them to revive and bring life to the people. </p></li>
        <li><u>The Fifth Sun - Earthquake Sun </u><br>
            <br>
            <figure><img src="proj_images/fifth-sun.jpg" alt="fifth" width="250" height="250" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption id="gods4"><cite>Fifth sun god, Earthquake Sun</cite></figcaption></figure>
        <p id="cb4">To create a new sun, the gods gathered together. Tecuciztecatl offered to do it, but the other gods prefered Nanahuatzin. The gods made a big fire, and Nanahuatzin bravely jumped, and Tecuciztecatl followed. They were joined by a brave eagle and jaguar. Two bright suns showed up in the east, blindingly lighting the morning skies. To make it less bright, the gods threw a rabbit at Tecuciztecatl, turning him into the moon. Nanahuatzin recieved energy from the other gods and was renamed Tonatuih. Some people think his face is on the Aztec calendar stone &lpar;Aztec Sun God 2013, 'The final sun?', para 5&rpar;.</p></li>

        <h2>Aztec Practices</h2>

            </figure><br>
            <h3> Sacrifices </h3>
            <p> Common stereotypes surrounding Aztec sacrifices frame them as brutal and barbaric ceremonies centered solely on bloodshed. These portrayals often present the Aztecs as a society driven by a thirst for blood, characterized by cruelty and indifference towards human life. Yet, such simplistic views neglect the layers of religious, social, and ecological factors that shaped the Aztec rituals. Gratifying these stereotypes poses the danger of misinterpreting/overlooking the profound cultural and spiritual significance these rituals held within the Aztec society.
             Within a book by Charles Mann called, <q><i>1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus</i>,</q> a better sense of these sacrifices can be made by his comparisons.
            <br>
        <br>Mann writes about the Triple Alliance of the Aztecs, discussing of the ceremonial public killings in the city of Mexico—Tenochtitlan (The “Triple Alliance” refers to the group of 3 City-States within the Aztec Empire). According to Mann, the public killing count within these cities is somewhere around 3-4,000 people a year.
            Moreover, Charles Mann writes about the “Triple Alliance” of the Aztecs, and how our best estimates today of the number of people killed in ceremonial public killings in the city of Mexico-Tenochtitlan is somewhere between 3-4,000 people a year.
        <br>(<i>The “Triple Alliance” is the group of 3 City-States that is also often called “The Aztec Empire.” There were 3 distinct Ethnic Groups and City-States who ruled over much of the rest of Mexico in the 1400 & 1500's: Mexico-Tenochtitlan, Tlacopa, and Texcoco</i>).
            Ultimately, sacrifices were a political tool used by the leaders of Aztec/Mexica society, in addition to being a religious belief that people had for over thousands of years. This religious belief being heavily associated by gratitude. 
        <br> To the Aztecs, the ultimate gratitude for what has been provided is by sacrificing something just as important. On a day to day level, forms of gratitude would be expressed with bloodletting, or giving up something hunted that would be eaten.</p>
