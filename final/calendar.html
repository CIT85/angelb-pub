    <h3>Xiuhpohualli</h3>
    <p>The Aztec calendar that many of us know is the Xiuhpohualli.
    <br> The Calendar is based on the Aztec sunstone, a massive stone disk covered in intricate carvings and symbols arranged in concentric circles.</p>

    <p>The day count, or Tonalpohualli, is another name for the Xiuhpohualli. It was used as a divination tool, hence the term "holy calendar."
      The Aztecs saw this as a vital part of their cosmology since it divides the days and ceremonies among the gods.
      The foundation of the Aztec worldview is the idea that everything ultimately consists of two opposing forces.
      The belief that opposing gods were competing for power within the universe disrupted the peace and consistency of the two forces. 
    To prevent such chaos within the universe, the gods were given their own space, their own time, and social groups to rule over. </p>
    <p>The Tonalpohualli tells us how time is divided among gods. </p>
    <h3>Symbolism</h3>
    <p>The Aztec calendar, also known as the Sun Stone or Stone of the Five Eras, carries symbolic meaning. At its core is Tonatiuh, the sun god, representing life and energy. The circles and symbols portray various time cycles, like the 260-day ritual calendar &lpar;Tonalpohualli&npar; and the 365-day agricultural calendar &lpar;Xiuhpohualli&npar;. The four squares surrounding the central deity depict past world eras, each linked to a specific element. In essence, the Aztec calendar signifies the interaction of cosmic forces, cycles of creation and destruction, and the continual renewal of life.</p>

    <h4>Influeces</h4>
    <p>The Aztecs and Mayans are two of the most influential native civilizations heavily studied. They share many similarities with one another despite being centuries apart. However, they also differ. A prime example of this are the famous Aztec and Mayan Calendars. 
    <br>When compared to one another, the Mayan and Aztec Calendar Systems both have the infamous two cycles that both consist of 260 days. The Aztecs referred to their 260-day cycle as Tonalpohualli, while the Mayans named theirs Tzolkin. The 13 months were numbered from 1 to 13 instead of receiving specific names. Nevertheless, each of the 20 days in a month was associated with names linked to natural elements, animals, or cultural objects:</p>

    <p> Both calendars, featuring a 260-day and a 365-day cycle, include a 52-year "century" known as a "calendar round." This occurs because, after 52 of the 365-day years, the Xiuhpohualli/Haab and Tonalpohualli/Tzolkin cycles synchronize once again. After 52 days ( out of the 365-day years) in each calendar, a corresponding span of 73 of the 260-day religious cycles occurs. The start of a new calendar round takes place on the first day of the 53rd year.</p>
