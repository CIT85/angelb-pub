    <p id="pwb">The Mēxihcah, better known as The Aztecs, were a nothern tribe that migrated into southern Mesoamerica in the late 1200's.
       Despite their rich history, the exact origins of the Aztecs remains a mystery, leaving historians with unanswered questions about their appearance. 
       While the mystery of their background persists, what is clear is that the Aztecs eventually settled in the fertile basin of Lake Texcoco, 
       where they would go on to establish one of the most remarkable civilizations in Mesoamerican history.

      <p>Legends speak that the Aztecs were told by their gods to settle down from their journey once they found a lake with an eagle eating a snake atop a prickly pear cactus.
        According to these ancient tales, the gods provided the Aztecs with a divine sign, guiding them to the site where they were destined to build their great city. 
        The symbolic image of the eagle, snake, and cactus became a powerful emblem for the Aztecs, representing the fulfillment of a sacred prophecy and serving as a spiritual bind for their civilization.
        This mystical guidance, combined with the advantages of the lake's resources, played an important role in the establishment of their capital, Tenochtitlan.
